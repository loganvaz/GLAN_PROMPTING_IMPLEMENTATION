# GLAN_PROMPTING_IMPLEMENTATION
A version of GLAN based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13064 (as I understood - I am in no way associated with the authors of this paper and am just inspired by their work). Goal is to apply general framework to slightly more specific tree expansion.

# SETUP
First, in .env.local set the GPT KEY for use
Second, modify the config.py to suit your purpose
